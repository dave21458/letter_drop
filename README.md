Added a desktop version for Windows.
                  This is a standalone portable app. It does NOT have any installation or set up. Just download, unzip, and play.
                  I want to test this with others. So if you use the desktop version please give me feed back..
                  
                  The desktop version is powered by Phomium.(https://github.com/dave21458/Phomium.git). This is an experimental 
                  program that combines Chromium engine with PHP. This allows a programmer to use HTML5 , javascript and php to quickly
                  create desktop app that is fully portable.

Web app version : originally I was just playing around with different web stuff. I came up with this game that allows player vs player mode
                  requires a web host that run php + mysql.. has bugs i am sure, I left it here for future reference
                  
Android version : again just playing with programming for android. It works on my android jellybean tablet.
                  I was told it worked on a android phone but the screen was too small. So if you install this 
                  do it a 6" or larger screen.
